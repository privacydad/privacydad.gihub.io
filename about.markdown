I'm *Privacy Dad* and I work in security / intel field, dealing with privacy and security issues every day with my clients. I also have children. At home, at school, and with friends, they are discovering internet at a very younger age. We often have conversations about how things work, how and why to do (or not do) certain things online to make sure we stay safe. This site aims to put these discussions here, where they may be of use to parents around the world. Enjoy and stay safe!
